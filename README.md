There are many amoung us who love to read and write blogs. A blog (or weblog) is an information, a person wants to share, on any particular topic which is expressed and explained by that person in his/her own words. This app is to provide a platform that can be used as blogs repository. There is possibility to read blogs, written by other persons as well. 

## Features

This app is to provide an easy way to create, maintain, share and read blogs written by users around the world. All you need is to create a user on the app in simple 2 steps and start blogging. At start, of course there wouldn't be much and I am working on to get links for the already existing blogs by different users on anothers webs.
