            "content": "<p>Workers’ health, safety and well-being are vital concerns to hundreds of millions of working people worldwide. But the issue extends even further beyond individuals and their families. It is of paramount importance to the productivity, competitiveness and sustainability of enterprises, communities, and to national and regional economies. Currently, an estimated two million people die each year as a result of occupational accidents and work-related illnesses or injuries. Another 268 million non-fatal workplace accidents result in an average of three lost workdays per casualty, as well as 160 million new cases of work-related illness each year. Additionally, 8% of the global burden of disease from depression is currently attributed to occupational risks. These data, collected by the International Labour Organization and the World Health Organization, only reflect the injuries and illnesses that occur in formally registered workplaces. In many countries, most workers are employed informally in factories and businesses where there are no records of work-related injuries or illnesses, let alone any programmes to prevent injuries or illnesses. Addressing this huge burden of disease, economic costs and long-term loss of human resources from unhealthy workplaces is a formidable challenge for national governments, economic sectors, and health policy-makers and practitioners..</p>",

Developers also write HTML language code to specify how different items relate to one another in the page’s overall structure or document structure. Every website you open in your web browser, from social networks to music services, uses HTML. A look under the hood of any website would reveal a basic HTML code page, written with an HTML structure editor, providing structure for all the page’s components, including its header element, footer element, main content, and other inline elements..</p>",

To help you envision what your trajectory might look like after you conquer HTML, CSS and everything in between, we’ve outlined some common career paths for motivated coders. We’ll look at some popular coding specializations, the salaries you can expect to earn, and the must-have skills that will get you hired. Typical Coding Career Path One of the best aspects of the coding field is the almost unlimited growth potential. Here are some of the most common steps in a coder’s career journey, from first job to leader. Junior Developer The primary role of a junior developer is to build quality, bug-free software that meets client expectations. You’ll use your knowledge of programming languages, algorithms, and databases. As this is an entry-level position, you’ll spend a significant amount of time developing your coding skills. You may find coding certain applications a challenge, but this is your opportunity to learn the software development lifecycle. Senior Developer After gaining three to four years of experience, you’ll now be proficient in writing complex software applications. You’ll have also gained more in-depth knowledge of databases and algorithms. Now you’re fully aware of the complexity of the entire software/application lifecycle. Lead Architect A lead architect is responsible for designing the entire software system. You’ll oversee the day-to-day coding which is implemented by a team of junior developers. The technical skills gained with years of experience as a junior and senior developer help you take on the lead architect role. Mid-Level Manager The traditional way to move ahead in your career is to become a manager. Typical managerial roles include a product manager, developer manager, or a project manager. If you’re someone with strong leadership skills and can drive a team forwards, then this is the job for you. Senior Leader As you go further up the career ladder, your job will involve less coding. You’ll take on a role where you’ll be heading a team of mid-level managers. Your job is to motivate and inspire your team towards achieving company goals..</p>",

Test before and after. </li><li>Make it DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself is the mantra. Centralize repeated code. </li><li>YAGNI Principle: You Ain’t Gonna Need It. Don't add functionality that isn't required.\r\n</li></ul><p><b>\r\nThe Aftermath: The Clearing in the Forest\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nAfter your diligent refactoring, you should be standing in a clearing of clean code.

            "content": "<p><b>Introduction: The Developer's Best Friend\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nIf you're a developer, chances are you spend a good chunk of your day with Google—or a similar search engine—open in a browser tab. Whether you're debugging an error, looking for a library, or just stuck on a tricky piece of code, search engines are invaluable. But are you really getting the most out of your searches? Let's dive into how to Google like a pro.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nKeyword Crafting: The Right Phrase Makes All the Difference\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nSearch engines are all about keywords, but throwing in technical jargon haphazardly won't always yield the best results. Use specific keywords, and if the first search doesn’t yield useful results, try synonyms or related terms. For example, if you're looking for a Python function to remove duplicates from a list, you could try \"Python function remove duplicates list\" or \"Python unique items in list.\"\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nOperators: Your Hidden Arsenal\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nMost developers are unaware of the power of search operators. </p><ul><li>Use quotes for exact match searches like \"Cannot read property 'undefined' of null\". </li><li>Use the minus symbol to exclude words: JavaScript array methods -splice.\r\n</li></ul><p><b>\r\nSite-Specific Searches: Digging Deeper\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nWhen you know which websites often have the answers you seek, use site-specific searches. For example, to look for array-related questions on Stack Overflow, you could use array site:stackoverflow.com in your search query.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nAdvanced Search Features: The Extra Mile\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nGoogle offers an Advanced Search page that lets you fine-tune your searches by various criteria, including language, file type, and date range. This can be especially useful when you're looking for recent solutions to a problem related to a newly released library or tool.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nDon't Forget the Docs: Official Documentation as a Resource\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nWhile community forums and blogs are valuable resources, don't overlook the official documentation. Often, the most accurate and up-to-date information is found in the docs. You can usually get there quickly by adding docs to your search query, like React useState docs.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nCommunity Wisdom: Leverage Social Media and Forums\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nSometimes the information you seek is best found through community wisdom. Websites like Reddit, Twitter, and specialized forums often have unique insights or discussions that you won't find through a standard Google search.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nConclusion: Becoming a Google-Fu Master\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nMastering the art of effective searching is a skill every developer should have in their toolkit. By refining your search strategies, you'll save time and get back to what you do best—solving problems and writing great code.</p>",
